      <p>My interest in coding started in 2022.  I was deployed in Germany, and was working in a military website. I really did not like the set up of the page and wished it could be better and easily readable.  I wondered how it could be fixed. That is where I started doing reasearch and bumped into Web Development. I started watching videos about HTML on my free time.  When I decided to separate, I looked back to when i was learning about HTML and how interesting and fun i found it. So decided to chose this career path. </p>
